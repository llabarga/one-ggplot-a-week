# One ggplot a week
This is a small project for my Bluesky account (@labargui) where every week I post a different ggplot to show data of relevance. I am an R enthusiast and I thought of sharing different graphs I was doing while learning more about tidyverse !

### Graphs
**Week 1** Forest fires in Navarre

**Week 2** Cetacean sighting in Garraf

**Week 3** Coming soon...
